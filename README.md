# Capstone-Project-on-Funnel-Analysis

## üìã Overview
This project involves analyzing Swiggy's Funnel Data for the year 2019 to identify trends, fluctuations, and potential insights for decision-making. The goal is to evaluate the performance of Swiggy by examining the session details, traffic sources, and supporting data to understand order trends, traffic fluctuations, and conversion metrics.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
* Funnel Analysis Report (Word File)

  Insights derived from the  analysis.
  Reasons for order drops/hikes with respect to same-day last week.
  Analysis of traffic and conversion fluctuations.
  Hypotheses and their validation using supporting data.

* Supporting Excel File

  All calculations, charts, tables, and formatted data used to support insights.
  Includes the following sheets:
  Session Details: Analysis of session-level data.
  Channel-Wise Traffic: Source of traffic fluctuations.

* Supporting Data: Metrics validating hypotheses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used
Data Source: Funnel Case Study Data workbook (3 sheets)

Tools:

* Microsoft Excel (for calculations, conditional formatting, and visualizations)
  
* Microsoft Word (for the insights report)
  
* GitHub (for version control and documentation)
  
Skills Applied:

Data analysis using Excel.
Funnel breakdown into smaller metrics (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O).
Identifying and validating hypotheses with data.

## üóùÔ∏è Key Objectives
* Order Trends:

  Identify dates with significant order fluctuations compared to the same day last week.
  Determine highs (above 20%) and lows (below -20%) in orders.

* Traffic Analysis:

  Identify changes in traffic as compared to the same day last week.
  Pinpoint the source of traffic fluctuations using the Channel-Wise Traffic sheet.

* Conversion Analysis:

  Analyze overall conversion trends compared to previous dates.
  Break conversions into smaller metrics:
  L2M: Listing to Menu conversion
  M2C: Menu to Cart conversion
  C2P: Cart to Payment conversion
  P2O: Payment to Order conversion
  Identify and explain fluctuations in smaller conversion metrics.

* Hypotheses and Validation:

  Develop hypotheses for fluctuations in orders and conversions.
  Validate these hypotheses using the Supporting Data sheet.

## üìä Key Features
Structured Insights:
Highlights significant order drops and hikes, along with reasons backed by data.
Traffic Fluctuation Analysis:
Determines changes in traffic sources leading to variations.
Conversion Metrics Breakdown:
Tracks fluctuations in L2M, M2C, C2P, and P2O metrics.
Data-Driven Hypotheses:
Validates reasons for changes using metrics like average discount, packaging charges, and success rate of payments.
